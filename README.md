## How to change UI 
### Adding simple text
Phaser is very simple.

For example you want to add text 'Hello world!'.
In phaser it looks like.
```
this.add.text(x, y, 'Hello World!'). 
```
x, y - position on screen. 
this - scene where you want to add it. 

### Adding image
At first you should add image to public/assets. 
Then go to public/js/scenes/preloadScene.js. 
Add image to preload function. 
```
this.load.image('name', 'assets/name_of_your_image.jpg');
```
You are ready to add it to scene!  
```
this.add.image(x, y, 'name');
```
You can try it on GameUIScene or MainScene. 
## About Idea
OpenMetaverse is a project where people with NFTs can find their communities and talk to each other with perfect voice chat.    
In plans I want to add different rooms for NFT collections and watching films.
